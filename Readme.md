# Description
Jenny is an interpreted stack-based procedural programming language.
I was inspired to create Jenny after watching Tsoding's videos on the creation of Porth.

All Jenny source files must use the ".jen" file extension.

# How to run the Jenny interpreter (as of Alpha v1.2)
Step 1: Download the source code
  
Step 2: Run the source code in your java IDE with an run configuration for applications
  
Step 3: Type in the path to the file you want to run
  
After step 3, you will be running a Jenny program
